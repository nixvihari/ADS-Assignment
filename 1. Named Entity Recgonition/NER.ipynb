    "- A Named entity is any that is a noun, i.e an instance of a person, place or a thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a technique used to classify named entities into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "NER can be seen as a multiclass classification problem where we try to identify the class of the entity and assign the highest probable class to which it seems to belong. These classes are predefined categories which represent class/group of instances in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: \n",
    "- Places\n",
    "    - Countries\n",
    "    - States\n",
    "- Institution\n",
    "    - School\n",
    "    - College\n",
    "    - Offices\n",
    "- Persons\n",
    "\n",
    "- NER serves as a bridge between unstructured text and structured data, by being able to provide context for the text.\n",
    "- NER facilitating tasks like data analysis, information retrieval, and knowledge graph construction."
